        <h2><strong>Are banks closed on veterans day november 11th Veterans day activity for 1st graders</strong></h2>
        <p>The Missing Man Table, sometimes referred to as the &ldquo;Fallen Comrade Table,&rdquo; is meant to remind viewers of those fallen, missing, or imprisoned U.S. Military Service Members. Each item on the Missing Man Table represents the emotions and feelings reserved for those who did not come home.  <b>Set</b> for six, the empty <b>places</b> represent Americans still [our men] missing from each of the five services -- Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Coast Guard &ndash; and civilians. This Honors Ceremony symbolizes that they are with us, here in spirit.  A missing man table, also known as a fallen comrade table, [1] is a ceremony and memorial that is set up in military dining facilities of the United States Armed Forces and during official dining functions, in honor of fallen, missing, or imprisoned military service members. [2]  An empty <b>place</b> <b>setting</b> is a tradition at military ceremonies. It commemorates those comrades who have yet to return. This is the meaning and history behind the empty table at <b>military</b> mess...  Each detail of the table symbolizes an aspect of the POW/MIA&rsquo;s life or fate, or of those whom they left behind. The table is displayed to signify those who are missing but are not forgotten. <b>Set</b>...  We call your attention to this small table, which occupies a <b>place</b> of dignity and honor near the head table. It is <b>set</b> for one, symbolizing the fact that members of our armed forces are missing from our ranks. They are referred to as POWs and MIAs.  If you&#39;ve ever been to a military ball, stepped inside a chow hall, or attended an event at a <b>military</b> <b>veterans</b> association in your local community, you&#39;ve likely noticed the small, round table that is always <b>set</b> but never occupied - the prisoners of war/missing in action (POW/MIA) table.  Sometimes the <b>setting</b> features the Bible to represent spiritual strength and faith that loved ones will return home. The table at the Virginia War Memorial is <b>set</b> with a single <b>place</b> <b>setting</b> to remember those who are absent and cannot attend a meal because of their POW or MIA status.  The Uniform Holiday Bill (Public Law 90-363 (82 Stat. 250)) was signed on June 28, 1968, and was intended to ensure three-<b>day</b> weekends for Federal employees by celebrating four national holidays on Mondays: Washington&rsquo;s Birthday, Memorial <b>Day</b>, <b>Veterans</b> <b>Day</b>, and Columbus <b>Day</b>. </p>        <p>Veterans day printable sign.
